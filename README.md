2017 PhD talk on music repetitiveness using temporal segmentation.

See the attached PDF for the slides of my talk. The Python code does the temporal segmentation using librosa (https://librosa.github.io/librosa/), outputs recurrance values and diagrams for each song in the sample.

To do's: temporal and spectral clustering analysis of the sample.
